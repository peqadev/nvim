# nvim

This is my personal configuration for nvim. It's still a work in progress, and constantly being updated every time I find something that can either make my development faster or my improve the perfomance of VIM.

## Requirements

1. Install `sudo apt install python3-venv`
1. Install `sudo apt install python3-pip`

## Installation

1. Install nvim 0.9+.
1. Create a new config folder, if you don't have it. `mkdir -p ~/.config/`
1. Git clone this project inside that directory. `git clone git@github.com:peqadev/nvim.git`
1. Start having fun :D.

You're ready to use all this configs :).
